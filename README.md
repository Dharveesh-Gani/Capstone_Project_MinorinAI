# Capstone_Project_MinorinAI
This project explores an unsupervised, multimodal framework for understanding the biotech equity market by jointly modeling long-horizon stock behavior and clinical trial information. The project is done as part of partial fulfillment of the Minor in AI program conducted by IIT Ropar.

# Multimodal Representation Learning for Biotech Equity Regime Discovery

#### Overview

This project presents an unsupervised, multimodal representation learning framework designed to study and characterize the highly non-linear, event-driven nature of the biotech equity market. By jointly modeling long-horizon stock price behavior and clinical trial information, the system uncovers latent market structures, identifies investment regimes, and evaluates their utility through systematic backtesting.

Rather than focusing on short-term price prediction, the model is framed as a risk-tolerant “moonshot” screener, analogous to a venture-capital-style investor that seeks asymmetric upside opportunities inherent to biotech markets.

#### Key Objectives

* Learn compact latent representations of biotech stocks without labeled supervision

* Fuse temporal market dynamics with clinical maturity signals to improve regime discovery

* Rank stocks and classify regimes using interpretable latent dimensions

* Evaluate the economic relevance of learned regimes through portfolio backtesting

#### Methodology Summary

* Unsupervised representation learning on long-horizon stock time series

* Dimensionality reduction and latent structure discovery via PCA

* Multimodal fusion of stock-derived embeddings with clinical trial features

* Regime ranking based on normalized latent scores

* Monthly rebalanced, equal-weighted BUY-only backtesting framework

#### Evaluation & Results

* Learned representations capture global market trends while suppressing high-frequency noise

* Multimodal fusion improves cluster separation compared to stock-only embeddings

* Backtests show higher cumulative and annualized returns than an equal-weight benchmark

* Classical statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA) show weak significance due to limited sample size and high variance

* Downside-risk-aware evaluation using the Sortino ratio better reflects model behavior and strengths

#### Interpretation

The strategy behaves less like a low-volatility institutional allocator and more like a broad, high-risk, high-reward investor, where a small number of large winners drive overall performance. This behavior is characteristic of the biotech sector and is poorly captured by traditional variance-based statistical tests, motivating the use of alternative risk metrics.

#### Future Work

* Expand the temporal horizon and number of clinical data points

* Engineer richer clinical representations (e.g., LLM/BioBERT-based embeddings of trial summaries)

* Perform extensive ablation studies across fusion strategies and model components

* Replace LSTM-based encoders with attention-based architectures such as Temporal Fusion Transformers

* Improve statistical power through longer backtesting horizons and denser datasets

#### Disclaimer

* This project is academic and exploratory in nature. It is not financial advice and should not be used for live trading without extensive validation, stress testing, and risk controls.
  
* Certain sections of the notebook contains boilerplate code generated by AI models (Gemini and OpenAI) for efficiency and to mitigate time limitation, although with manual tweaking and significant manual review/changes wherever needed.
  
* Before running the notebook follow the file structure according to the repository strictly and go through the requirements.txt file for installing necessary dependencies.

* Run the below command in terminal within the downloaded repository directory 
pip install -r requirements.txt
